Abstract InteractObj --> Guardian + Item
    - this is because I want to put these two objects into the same list that each room will store the objects in.

Character can access interact with items by attribute Bags through slot number of bag

getInfo on InteractObj class -> so that all succeeding class have to implement this method which required for character to inspect()
